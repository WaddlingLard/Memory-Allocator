# Project: Memory Allocator

* Author: Brian Wu
* Class: CS452 Section #002
* Semester: Spring 2025

## Overview

An implementation of the buddy system in c using a balloc module

## Reflection


## Compiling and Using

To compile the code, first cd into the `hw2` directory.
Then, run this command 

```make```

and then...

```./memoryalloc```

OR... if you want to run immediately after building use

```make run```

Just make sure the file structure is not disturbed and all should be good!

Note: Main will contain all the tests. They are mostly just output statements but there will be enough information to verify the allocator is working. There is also a little deq test at the bottom to show they are linking up and working properly
